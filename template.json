Write a short form video script based on the user's topic that exactly complies with the following guide, and uses the example script below for reference on format, detail level and quality. \n\nKey shortform video guide:\n```\nWriting:\n\n1. Hooks:\n   - Keep hooks under 3 seconds, absolutely no longer\n   - Make them visually pleasing and understandable without sound - test by watching on mute\n   - Use foreshadowing to tease the video's conclusion, but don't reveal everything\n   - Example: Start with a reaction to a $5 gift, but don't show the gift itself until the end\n   - Ensure the hook is so visually strong it could be used as a thumbnail for a long-form video\n\n2. Storytelling:\n   - \"But so\" storytelling: Constantly set up and resolve conflicts\n     Example: \"I was at home but I got bored, so I ended up going for a walk, but it started raining, so I ended up trying to figure out what to do.\"\n   - Dual narrative storytelling:\n     - Voice: Focus on the main action or process\n     - Visuals: Add emotional depth or context without explicitly stating it\n     Example: Talking about making a $5 Valentine's gift while showing photos of grandma with late grandpa\n   - Create multiple \"but\" moments to repeatedly grab attention\n\n3. Language:\n   - Be ruthlessly concise - cut any word that doesn't add value\n   - Use \"but\" and \"so\" frequently to create micro-cliffhangers\n   - Avoid explaining what's visually obvious\n\n4. Content:\n   - Address 2-3 potential viewer questions in each video\n   - Provide multiple reasons for viewers to care (e.g., health benefits AND weight loss for a diet video)\n   - Use numbered lists (e.g., \"3 reasons why\") to create clear structure and expectation\n\nDirecting:\n\n1. Visual Composition:\n   - Center all important elements in the frame\n   - Limit to 2-3 objects max in any given shot\n   - First frame must be thumbnail-worthy - test this specifically\n\n2. Pacing:\n   - Hook: 1-3 seconds, ultra-fast\n   - Middle: Medium pace, but with micro-variations to maintain interest\n   - Peak: Place a clear high point (joke, reveal, etc.) around 60-70% through\n   - Quick ending: Last 2-3 seconds should wrap up decisively\n\n3. Emotional Journey:\n   - Plan 3-4 distinct emotional beats in each video\n   - Ensure the peak emotion (whether humor, surprise, etc.) is crystal clear\n   - End on the second-strongest emotional beat\n\n4. Speaking:\n   - Speak at a normal pace, but cut out all filler words\n   - After every dense information bit, pause for 0.5-1 second\n   - Vary tone to emphasize key points - don't be monotonous\n\n5. Visuals:\n   - Every 2-3 seconds should have a visual change (new shot, text overlay, etc.)\n   - Use visual metaphors to explain complex ideas quickly\n   - Incorporate progress indicators (e.g., step counters) to maintain viewer orientation\n\nStructure:\n\n1. Overall Structure:\n   - Hook (1-3 seconds): Instantly grab attention\n   - Context (2-4 seconds): Quickly establish what's happening\n   - Main content (20-25 seconds): Deliver value in bite-sized chunks\n   - Peak (3-5 seconds): Clear climax or punchline\n   - Ending (1-2 seconds): Swift wrap-up\n\n2. Retention Tactics:\n   - Every single line must progress the story - ruthlessly cut any that don't\n   - Place \"but\" moments every 5-7 seconds to maintain tension\n   - Use visual progress indicators that are always on screen (e.g., step counter in corner)\n\n3. Length:\n   - Aim for 30-35 seconds initially (Jenny's sweet spot is 34 seconds)\n   - Test variations of +/- 5 seconds to find your ideal length\n\n4. Call-to-Action (CTA):\n   - Place CTA at 50-60% mark in the video\n   - Integrate CTA into the story (e.g., \"Subscribe to see what happened next\")\n   - Keep CTA under 2 seconds\n\n5. Ending:\n   - Last 1-2 seconds should be quick and decisive\n   - Consider a cliffhanger ending to encourage rewatches\n   - If part of a series, tease the next video in the last second\n\n6. Content Buckets:\n   - Develop 2-4 distinct series with near-identical structures\n   - Use exact same title format for each video in a series\n   - Example bucket: \"$1 [food item] vs Restaurant version\"\n\n7. Testing and Iteration:\n   - Create at least 3 versions of each video, changing only one element\n   - Analyze first 24-48 hours of performance rigorously\n   - Look for patterns in top 10% of videos and double down on those elements\n```\n\nExample Script:\nHere's an example Full Script with Visual Direction (full_script) for a video titled \"How many flavors can I get for $1\":\n```\n[close-up of ice cream machine with multiple flavors visible] How many flavors can you get with a dollar?  \n[pan to show a full ice cream cup, price tag visible] That's going to be $20, and it's just vanilla.  \n[Jenny holding a tiny cup, moving towards ice cream machine] So I brought a tiny cup to get every flavor without spending more than a dollar.  \n[close-up of tiny cup under ice cream dispenser] What do these levers do?  \n[Jenny's mom entering frame, looking concerned] Jenny, they're gonna kick you out!  \n[cup filling with multiple colors of ice cream] I'm more concerned that the more flavors I added, the less space I had in my cup.  \n[Jenny eating some ice cream from the cup] Oh my goodness, I put the same flavor twice on accident.  \n[Jenny looking around furtively] Testing to make extra room.  \n[store employee walking by in background] They're gonna kick us out. Look, I called the cops!  \n[text overlay \"Subscribe for more challenges!\"] All this for one subscriber.  \n[close-up of ice cream machine with multiple levers] So I hurry through the final flavors by pressing a special button that adds two flavors at once.  \n[cup overflowing slightly, Jenny looking panicked] That's more than a dollar! Hurry up!  \n[Jenny holding the overfilled cup, moving to cashier] 14 ice cream flavors... is it gonna be a dollar?  \n[cash register display showing price] $2.48  \n[Jenny's disappointed face, quick cut to black] No ice cream for you... again.  \n```\n\nThis script follows the key principles of:\n- A quick, visually appealing hook\n- Constant progression and conflict\n- Dual narrative storytelling (spoken story about getting flavors, visual story about potentially getting in trouble)\n- Foreshadowing the ending (mentioning \"again\" to hint at a previous video)\n- Quick, impactful ending\nRemember, every single second and line serves a purpose in moving the story forward and maintaining viewer engagement.\n\n- [text between brackets] will be used to guide the the visuals and ignored by the speaker\n- Breaking lines to force clip separation and media change\n\nEverything written outside of [ ] will be spoken aloud, so never include non-spoken words like \"*sigh*\" and just leave empty lines rather than marking sections as \"None\".\n\nOutput only the full script with no commentary or additional text, titles or parenthesis.", "prompt_values": {}}}], "version": 10, "is_active": true, "subgraphs": {}, "executions": null, "description": "AI Shortform Video Generator: Create Viral-Ready Content in Seconds\n\nTransform trending topics into engaging shortform videos with this cutting-edge AI Video Generator.
